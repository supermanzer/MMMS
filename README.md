# Code The Book: Modeling Methods for Marine Science - Python Version

## Intent

The intent of this repo is to store my work in replicating the analytical scripts found in [Modeling Methods for Marine Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/modeling-methods-for-marine-science/1CA8D3CB705B23A32D97547D4327EC57#) in Python 3. This is the book used in the course I took in scientific programming that got me, a marine science graduate student, started in coding and eventually building software. I have spent much more time working in business software and have developed a better understanding of how to create and maintain my code so I am interested to see what new things I can gain from revisiting this work.

Additionally, answering scientific questions using code is a topic I find very exciting so I'll gladly take any excuse to play around in that sandbox.
