# Code The Book: Modeling Methods for Marine Science - Python Version

## Intent

The intent of this repo is to store my work in replicating the analytical scripts found in [Modeling Methods for Marine Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/modeling-methods-for-marine-science/1CA8D3CB705B23A32D97547D4327EC57#) in Python 3. This is the book used in the course I took in scientific programming that got me, a marine science graduate student, started in coding and eventually building software. The original code is in MATLAB which was what the Physical Oceanography department at [Moss Landing Marine Labs](https://mlml.calstate.edu) was using at the time. I think that by working to translate this to Python functions and classes that do the same work I will gain a much better appreciation of the NumPy and SciPy packages. I have spent much more time working in business software and have developed a better understanding of how to create and maintain my code so I am interested to see what new things I can gain from revisiting this work.

Additionally, answering scientific questions using code is a topic I find very exciting so I'll gladly take any excuse to play around in that sandbox.

## Python Version

I am using the Anaconda distribution of Python for Scientific Computing for this endeavor. I am using Python version 3.8.5.

## Approach

I'm still trying to determine what the best way to maintain this code will be. For the initial chapters where I'm just practicing performing some scientific
computations in Python (as well as basic linear algebra and stats) I think Jupyter Notebooks will make for a handy way to both take notes and perform the
scripting. As I get into more complex work I would like to write custom functions and classes to keep my code more _Pythonic_
